The docs describe the attributes available on the request object (from flask import request) during a request. In most common cases request.data will be empty because it's used as a fallback:

request.data Contains the incoming request data as string in case it came with a mimetype Flask does not handle.

request.args: the key/value pairs in the URL query string
request.form: the key/value pairs in the body, from a HTML post form, or JavaScript request that isn't JSON encoded
request.files: the files in the body, which Flask keeps separate from form. HTML forms must use enctype=multipart/form-data or files will not be uploaded.
request.values: combined args and form, preferring args if keys overlap
request.json: parsed JSON data. The request must have the application/json content type, or use request.get_json(force=True) to ignore the content type.
All of these are MultiDict instances (except for json). You can access values using:

request.form['name']: use indexing if you know the key exists
request.form.get('name'): use get if the key might not exist
request.form.getlist('name'): use getlist if the key is sent multiple times and you want a list of values. get only returns the first value.
